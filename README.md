# LinkedIn Job Notifier - AI-Assisted Chrome Extension

## Overview

This is an open-source Chrome extension designed to give job seekers a competitive edge by instantly notifying them of new job postings on LinkedIn that match their criteria. In a job market where popular roles receive thousands of applications within hours, getting your application in early can make all the difference. This tool aims to level the playing field.

## The "Why"

The primary motivation behind this project is to provide a fair chance to everyone. We've all seen promising job posts that are already saturated with thousands of applicants just hours after being published. This tool was created to automate the discovery process, allowing you to be one of the first to apply, increasing your visibility to recruiters.

## Features

*   **Real-time Notifications:** Get instant desktop notifications for new jobs that match your filters.
*   **Advanced Filtering:** Set criteria for keywords, company, location, and date posted.
*   **"Easy Apply" Focus:** Filter specifically for jobs that support LinkedIn's "Easy Apply" feature.
*   **Smart Auto-Search:** The extension doesn't just refresh the page; it actively performs new searches in the background to find relevant posts.
*   **Multi-Language Support:** The UI is available in English and Turkish, with automatic language detection based on your browser settings.
*   **In-App List Management:** Filter, sort (newest/oldest), and mark found jobs as "viewed" directly within the extension's popup.

## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development & Project Status

This tool was developed using a modern, AI-assisted workflow, akin to **AI Pair Programming**. A significant portion of the code was generated, refactored, and debugged in collaboration with a large language model (LLM), which allowed for extremely rapid prototyping and feature implementation. This project serves as a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration in software development.

As a result of this rapid, iterative process, the project should be considered a **work in progress**.

**Disclaimer:** While functional, the extension has not yet undergone extensive bug testing. It is provided as-is, and you may encounter issues. We encourage the community to report bugs and help us improve it!

## üöÄ Future Roadmap

This is just the beginning. We have ambitious plans to evolve this tool into a comprehensive job application assistant. Our future goals include:

*   **AI-Powered Resume & Cover Letter Customization:** Integrate AI to analyze job descriptions and suggest tailored edits for your resume and cover letter for each application.
*   **Automated Application Submission:** Develop a feature to automatically fill out and submit applications for pre-approved job postings.
*   **Desktop Application:** Potentially expand the tool into a standalone desktop app for more powerful features and platform independence.
